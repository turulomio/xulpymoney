# Proyect Archived

This project has been archived because I've developed django_moneymoney (backend) and moneymoney (frontend) to replace it. These projects improve xulpymoney using vue as a SPA instead of a desktop app with PyQt5. Give it a try ;)

You can still use xulpymoney, it's working fine and it's a good code repository of python with QT.

# Install in Linux

If you use Gentoo, you can find the ebuild in https://github.com/turulomio/myportage/tree/master/app-office/xulpymoney

If you use another distribution, you nee to install PyQtChart and PyQtWebEngine manually. They aren't in Linux setup.py dependencies due to PyQt5 doesn't use standard setup tools. So for compatibility reasons with distributions like Gentoo, we use this additional step.

`pip install PyQtChart`

`pip install PyQtWebEngine`

`pip install xulpymoney`

# Install in Windows

You just must download xulpymoney-X.X.X.exe and execute it. It's a portable app so it tooks a little more time to start.

If you prefer there is a binary zip version in xulpymoney-X.X.X.zip. You can extract it and execute xulpymoney executable.

# Install in Windows with Python

Install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/ and don't forget to add python to the path during installation.

Open a CMD console

`pip install xulpymoney`

If you want to create a Desktop shortcut you can write in console

`xulpymoney_shortcuts`

# How to launch Xulpymoney

Just type:

`xulpymoney`

Xulpymoney uses PostgreSQL database as its backend. So you need to create a database and load its schema. You can create it from login dialog
